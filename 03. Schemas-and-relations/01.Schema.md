# Schemas

- Schema means structure of a document. What fields does it have. What is the type of each field.
- MongoDB enforces no schema. Documents don't have to use the same schema inside one collection.
- Even though mongoDB does not enforces a schema for documents, it's still good to have some structure defined for our documents.
- In SQL world every document has exact same structure. While mongoDB does not enforces structure it's generally a good idea to have some structure. We can have some core fields that every document has and then we can have extra fields that some of our documents will have.
