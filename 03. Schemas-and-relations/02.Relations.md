# Relations

- How to store related data?
- Should we use embedded documents or different collections


## Problem with embedding

- Lets say we have a `users` collection and their fav books as embedded array.
- In this case there will be lots of duplication as multiple users can have same favourite books.
- Also, later if we update a book, thet needs to be updated at multiple places at user level.
