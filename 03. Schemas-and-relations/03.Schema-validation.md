# Schema validation

- Though mongoDB is very flexible and schemaless in general, Sometimes we want our documents to have a rigid structure.
- While inserting or updating documents into a collection, if the passed data does not obey the schema rules defined, it should throw an error.

```ts
db.createCollection('name', { validator: {} })
```
