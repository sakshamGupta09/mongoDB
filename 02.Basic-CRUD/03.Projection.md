# Projection

- Lets say we have a document with a lots of fields.
- Client only needs few of those fields and not all.
- In that case we should not send all the data because it is unnecessary and impacts bandwidth as data still will be transfered over the network.
- When querying mongoDB server, we can ask for specific fields and not all the data.

```ts
db.collection.find({}, { name: 1 })
```
