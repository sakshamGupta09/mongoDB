# CRUD Operations

```js
show dbs
```
- This will list all the databases present in the server.


```ts
use dbName
```

- We can switch to a database using `use` command followed by the name of the db we want to switch to.
- We can even switch to dbs which do not exist yet. They will be created on the fly.

## Create database and collections

- We use `db` keyword to reference to current database.
- Then we mention the `collection` name we want to interact with.

## insertOne

-
