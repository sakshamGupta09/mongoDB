# CRUD Operations


## Database

```js
show dbs
```
- This will list all the databases present in the server.


```ts
use dbName
```

- We can switch to a database using `use` command followed by the name of the db we want to switch to.
- We can even switch to dbs which do not exist yet. They will be created on the fly. We need to add data to this db for it to be created,


## Collections

- A database will have many collections.
- We use `db` keyword to reference to current database.
- Then we mention the `collection` name we want to interact with. If the collection does not exists in the DB, it will be created on the fly.



## Inserting Data

```ts
db.collectionName.insertOne(document)
```

- This will insert one document in the collection.
- The document is of the JSON format.
- For every document inserted, mongo will create a unique `_id` field that has a unique value across a collection like a primary key.
