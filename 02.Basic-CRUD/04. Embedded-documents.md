# Embedded Documents

- We have a field in our document whose value is another document or an array of documents.


## Searching embedded documents

## Arrays

- We just need to specify one of the possible array values.
- mongoDB will search for documents which have one of the values present in a list.

```ts
db.collection.findOne({hobbies: ['sports']})
```
