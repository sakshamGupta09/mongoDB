# Embedded Documents

- We have a field in our document whose value is another document or an array of documents.


## Searching embedded documents

## Arrays

- We just need to specify one of the possible array values.
- mongoDB will search for documents which have one of the values present in a list.

```ts
db.collection.findOne({hobbies: ['sports']})
```


## Objects

- We can query in the filter for nested field values just like we access object properties with a dot.
- In this case it is important to wrap our field in quotes otherwise it will not work.

```ts
db.collection.findOne({"status.description": ['sports']})
```
