# What is mongoDB

- It's a database solution.
- MongoDB server consists of several databases. Each database can have multiple collections.
- Collection is like a table from SQL world.
- Each collection will have multiple documents. Document is like a row in SQL world's table.
- Document is nothing but data stored in a JSON format.


## Key characteristics


### No Schema

- In SQL, a table follows a strict schema and every row in that table adhers to it.
- Multiple documents in a collection can have different structures.


### Less relations

- SQL preaches normalization and splittig data across multiple table.
- Mongo instead can store embedded or nested fileds inside a documnent within a collection.
- There is no need to merge multiple tables as all data is present in a single collection because of nested documents.


## MongoDB server, drivers and shell

- All the data is hosted on mongoDB server.
- Foremost thing is to start and connect to the server.
- Once that's done, we need a way to communicate with this server. We can do that using a shell on local system or a driver if we are communicating with the server through a programming language.
